I'm new to this, so my main goal is to create a working keyboard that's decent to use.

# TODO

Flip power switch footprint
Add power switch footprint to bottom side
Flip controller silk text
Add controller silk to bottom side
Route button around switch, not underneath
Add mounting holes
Buy buttons or use a different button footprint

# Ergogen

Ergogen is a keyboard generator that aims to provide a common configuration format to describe **ergonomic** 2D layouts, and generate automatic plates, cases, and (un-routed) PCBs for them.
The project grew out of (and is an integral part of) the [Absolem keyboard](https://zealot.hu/absolem), and shares its [Discord server](https://discord.gg/nbKcAZB) as well.

For usage and config information, please refer to the [docs](https://docs.ergogen.xyz).
