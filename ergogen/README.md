# Ergogen

Ergogen is a keyboard generator that aims to provide a common configuration format to describe **ergonomic** 2D layouts, and generate automatic plates, cases, and (un-routed) PCBs for them.
The project grew out of (and is an integral part of) the [Absolem keyboard](https://zealot.hu/absolem), and shares its [Discord server](https://discord.gg/nbKcAZB) as well.

For usage and config information, please refer to the [docs](https://docs.ergogen.xyz).

## How to use

The main file to mess with is "config.yaml", which describes how the keyboard should be constructed using Ergogen's syntax. Pasting that file's contents into [this site](https://ergogen.cache.works/) will build the 2D and 3D representations of the keyboard and basic case structure.
