I'm new to this, so my main goal is to create a working keyboard that's decent to use.

# TODO

- Flip power switch footprint
- Add power switch footprint to bottom side
- Use reversible controller footprint
- Flip controller silk text
- Add controller silk to bottom side
- Route button around switch, not underneath
- Add mounting holes

# Ergogen

Ergogen is a keyboard generator that aims to provide a common configuration format to describe **ergonomic** 2D layouts, and generate automatic plates, cases, and (un-routed) PCBs for them.
The project grew out of (and is an integral part of) the [Absolem keyboard](https://zealot.hu/absolem), and shares its [Discord server](https://discord.gg/nbKcAZB) as well.

For usage and config information, please refer to the [docs](https://docs.ergogen.xyz).
